# "How Covid-19 infected the Airbnb market"
# A study on the impact of Covid-19 infections on the AirBnb market in Amsterdam

__Long project title, e.g.,*not yet determined

Research question: To what extend did the type of room, the reviews and the prices change of AirBnbs in Amsterdam during Covid-19, and what is the relationship between these variables and the number of infections?

## Motivation
At the end of 2019, the first infection of the corona virus was detected in China and since then this virus has gripped almost all countries in the world (Chen et al., 2020).The Netherlands has also been affected by the corona virus and has had to take various measures to limit the spread of the corona virus. Some examples of these gripping measures are:

* Keep 1.5 meters away from people who are not part of your household;
* All non-essential visiting locations were closed;
* Only use public transport if necessary.

The above examples are just a few examples of the measures and it is almost inconceivable that these measures have not had an impact on the AirBnb market. As a result of the number of infections in the Netherlands, the Dutch government flushed out and tighted the measures several times. Therefore, this study will pay attention to the effect of the infections in the Netherlands on several variables of the AirBnb market. Because it is expected that Covid-19 affects different aspects within the AirBnb market, different variables will be taken into account namely: the prices of AirBnbs in Amsterdam, The reviews from AirBnbs in Amsterdam and the types of AirBnbs rented in Amsterdam. 

Research by the RIVM (2020) shows that people in the Netherlands in the second wave adhered less well to the measures taken by the government. It will therefore also be examined whether there was a difference between the first and second wave in the above variables.


Ultimately, this study will therefore answer the following questions:
* What is the effect on the pricse of AirBnbs in Amsterdam, The reviews from AirBnbs in Amsterdam and the types of AirBnbs rented in Amsterdam of Covid-19 compared to before the pandemic? 
* How did the prices of AirBnbs in Amsterdam, The reviews from AirBnbs in Amsterdam and the types of AirBnbs rented in Amsterdam change during Covid-19 and what is the relationship with the number of infections in North Holland?
* Is there a big difference in the pricse of AirBnbs in Amsterdam, The reviews from AirBnbs in Amsterdam and the types of AirBnbs rented in Amsterdam between the first and second wave in the Neterlands? 


With the information obtained from this study, AirBnb owners can more easily respond to the wishes of customers during the next pandemic or epidemic and thereby limit their economic damage from that pandemic/epidemic. Covid-19 is not the first pandemic/epidemic that the earth has known and research expects that it will not be the last (WHO, 2020). 
This study therefore helps AirBnb owners to prepare for the next pandemic/epidemic.
