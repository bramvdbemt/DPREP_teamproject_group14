# "How Covid-19 infected the Airbnb market"
# A study on the impact of Covid-19 infections on the AirBnb market in Amsterdam

__Long project title, e.g.,*not yet determined

Research question: To what extend did the type of room, the reviews and the prices change of AirBnbs in Amsterdam during Covid-19, and what is the relationship between these variables and the number of infections?

## Motivation

Since at such dates like (Eurovision, World cup etc.) where there is many demand there is many types and variety of accomondations (expensive, big, central, small, house, apartment, shared) but maybe consumers prefer certain types more at the point of time. So we can gather data to look into what consumers prefer and share these insights with managers/providers to fluctuate their offering to better suit these consumers at these times. So that the main problem that will be solved is more demand matching supply, and more people finding what they need, and less accommodations being empty that effects the economy at these certain dates.
