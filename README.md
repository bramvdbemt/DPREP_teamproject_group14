Research question: To what extent can accomondation owners change their business model at peak dates where there is certain international events at the city, in order to better match supply and demand that in turns positively effects the economy?

## Motivation

Since at such dates like (Eurovision, World cup etc.) where there is many demand there is many types and variety of accomondations (expensive, big, central, small, house, apartment, shared) but maybe consumers prefer certain types more at the point of time. So we can gather data to look into what consumers prefer and share these insights with managers/providers to fluctuate their offering to better suit these consumers at these times. So that the main problem that will be solved is more demand matching supply, and more people finding what they need, and less accommodations being empty that effects the economy at these certain dates.
